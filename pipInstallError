1. Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 28] No space left on device 设备上没有空间
Reason: not enough space in /tmp, create ~/tmp instead. This method recommended, since linux would not use the root cache to make linux stucked
$ cd ~
$ mkdir tmp
$ export TMPDIR=$HOME/tmp
2. install packages in requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
